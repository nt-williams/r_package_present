```

## A little background

## Creating the initial package

To get setup, we can first check to see if the `devtools` package is installed and if not install it. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools") 
  library(devtools)
} else {
  library(devtools)
}
```

Once we have devtools loaded, we can create the skeleton of the package. This is where you get to decide the most important aspect of your package, it's name. 

In this case, we will name our package *foopkg*. To create the package we call `create_packages()` and specify where to create the project for the package on your computer. 

```{r}
create_package("~/Documents/foopkg")
```

My home directory for R is my "Documents" folder, if you have a different home directory or want to save the package in a different folder just modify the filepath. You should get an output similar to this
